## Overview
This project is a simple **Inventory Manager** web app.  
It allows you to **add and remove items** in an inventory table.  

**Goal:** Start with this template and **add new features** to make it more useful and interactive.  

---

## How to Run
1. Clone or download the repository.  
2. Open `index.html` in a browser.  
3. Use the form to add inventory items.  
4. View the table and remove items as needed.  

No server is required; everything runs in the browser.  

---

## Current Features
- Add items to the inventory (Name, Category, Quantity).  
- Remove items from the inventory.  
- Table displays all current items.  
- Shipments displays inventory coming *in*, triggered by Add Shipment
- Orders displays inventory going *out*, triggered by Add Order
- Add Category adds a new category (but does not add any products)

## Suggested Student Extensions

### 1. Inventory Calculations
- Show the **total quantity** of all items.  
- Add **price per item** and calculate **total value**.  

### 2. Sorting & Filtering
- Sort items by **name**, **category**, or **quantity**.  
- Filter Inventory display by **category**.  
- Add a **search box** to find items by name.  

### 3. Improved UI
- Highlight items with low quantity.  
- Add **color-coded categories**.  
- Make the table responsive for different screen sizes.  

### 4. Advanced Features
- Save inventory to **local storage** so it persists after closing the browser.  
- Import/export inventory as **CSV** files.  
- Add **undo/redo** functionality for changes.  
- Create "Add Products" functionality (specific to a category!)
